        <h3>Hey! Its Me!</h3>
        <p>I've been traveling about the world meeting people and learning what its all about. I still don't know what theat means, but its a start.</p>
        <p>I think that our abiltiy to express ourselves and our ideas is fundamentally the most important thing that humans can do. Therefore, I am deeply interested in both creating through art, literature, and code and experiencing the work of others.
